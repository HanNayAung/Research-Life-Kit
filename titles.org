Compared to legacy TCP/IP networking, a notable feature of ICN is to utilize in-network storages. ICN architectures basically adopt on-path caching mechanism. However, the benefits of on-path caching are limited because the caching is bounded to ICN nodes on the request path. To overcome the limitation of on-path caching mechanism, various types of off-path caching mechanism have...Show More
