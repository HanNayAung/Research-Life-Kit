* EFM: An Edge-Computing-Oriented Forwarding Mechanism for Information-Centric Networks
** Information-Centric Networking (ICN) has attracted much attention as a promising future network design, which presents a paradigm shift from host-centric to content-centric. However, in edge computing scenarios, there is still no specific ICN forwarding mechanism to improve transmission performance. In this paper, we propose an edge-oriented forwarding mechanism (E...Show More
